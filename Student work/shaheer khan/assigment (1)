Program to find odd and even number;
n = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
for i in n:
if i % 2 == 0:
print(f'{i} is an even number')
else:
print(f'{i} is an odd number')
code to find the average:
def processing_score(student1, student2, student3, student4):
    average = (student1 + student2 + student3 + student4) / 4
    return average
student1 = 23
student2 = 25
student3 = 22
student4 = 26
verage_score = processing_score(student1, student2, student3, student4)
print("Average score:",average_score)
finding highest score;
def processing_score(student1, student2, student3, student4):
    largest_score = max(student1, student2, student3, student4)
    return largest_score
student1 = 23
student2 = 25
student3 = 22
student4 = 26
print(processing_score(student1, student2, student3,Â student4))
finding the lowes score:
def processing_score(student1, student2, student3, student4):
    largest_score = min(student1, student2, student3, student4)
    return largest_score
student1 = 23
student2 = 25
student3 = 22
student4 = 26
print(processing_score(student1, student2, student3,Â student4))
